                        &ldquo;You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or
                        two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,
                        they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin
                        upon?&rdquo; said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable
                        ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of
                        course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness <em>nil</em>, has no
                        real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.
                        These things are mere abstractions.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; said the Psychologist.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have
                        a real existence.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;There I object,&rdquo; said Filby. &ldquo;Of course a solid body
                        may exist. All real things&mdash;&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an
                        <em>instantaneous</em> cube exist?&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; said Filby.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real
                        existence?&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Filby became pensive. &ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; the Time Traveller
                        proceeded, &ldquo;any real body must have extension in <em>four</em>
                        directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and&mdash;Duration.
                        But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you
                        in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four
                        dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth,
                        Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between
                        the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our
                        consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from
                        the beginning to the end of our lives.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to
                        relight his cigar over the lamp; &ldquo;that . . . very clear
                        indeed.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively
                        overlooked,&rdquo; continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of
                        cheerfulness. &ldquo;Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,
                        though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they
                        mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. <em>There is no
                        difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except
                        that our consciousness moves along it</em>. But some foolish people have got
                        hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to
                        say about this Fourth Dimension?&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;<em>I</em> have not,&rdquo; said the Provincial Mayor.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is
                        spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth,
                        and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each
                        at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been
                        asking why <em>three</em> dimensions particularly&mdash;why not another
                        direction at right angles to the other three?&mdash;and have even tried to
                        construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding
                        this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know
                        how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a
                        figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by
                        models of three dimensions they could represent one of four&mdash;if they
                        could master the perspective of the thing. See?&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting
                        his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one
                        who repeats mystic words. &ldquo;Yes, I think I see it now,&rdquo; he said
                        after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this
                        geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious.
                        For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at
                        fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All
                        these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations
                        of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Scientific people,&rdquo; proceeded the Time Traveller, after the
                        pause required for the proper assimilation of this, &ldquo;know very well
                        that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a
                        weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the
                        barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this
                        morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did
                        not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised?
                        But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must
                        conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the
                        fire, &ldquo;if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it,
                        and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot
                        we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of
                        Space?&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The Time Traveller smiled. &ldquo;Are you so sure we can move freely in
                        Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and
                        men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how
                        about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said the Medical Man. &ldquo;There are
                        balloons.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the
                        inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical
                        movement.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Still they could move a little up and down,&rdquo; said the
                        Medical Man.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Easier, far easier down than up.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the
                        present moment.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where
                        the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present
                        moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions,
                        are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the
                        cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel <em>down</em> if we began our
                        existence fifty miles above the earth&rsquo;s surface.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;But the great difficulty is this,&rdquo; interrupted the
                        Psychologist. &rsquo;You <em>can</em> move about in all directions of Space,
                        but you cannot move about in Time.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say
                        that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an
                        incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become
                        absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no
                        means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an
                        animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is
                        better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against
                        gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may
                        be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even
                        turn about and travel the other way?&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Oh, <em>this</em>,&rdquo; began Filby, &ldquo;is
                        all&mdash;&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the Time Traveller.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against reason,&rdquo; said Filby.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;What reason?&rdquo; said the Time Traveller.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;You can show black is white by argument,&rdquo; said Filby,
                        &ldquo;but you will never convince me.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; said the Time Traveller. &ldquo;But now you
                        begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four
                        Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine&mdash;&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;To travel through Time!&rdquo; exclaimed the Very Young Man.

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and
                        Time, as the driver determines.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Filby contented himself with laughter.

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;But I have experimental verification,&rdquo; said the Time
                        Traveller.

                        &ldquo;It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,&rdquo; the
                        Psychologist suggested. &ldquo;One might travel back and verify the
                        accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!&rdquo;

                        the Medical Man. &ldquo;Our ancestors had no great tolerance for
                        anachronisms.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;One might get one&rsquo;s Greek from the very lips of Homer and
                        Plato,&rdquo; the Very Young Man thought.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;In which case they would certainly plough you for the
                        Little-go. The German scholars have improved Greek so much.&rdquo;

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Then there is the future,&rdquo; said the Very Young Man.
                        &ldquo;Just think! One might invest all one&rsquo;s money, leave it to
                        accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!&rdquo;

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it
                        until&mdash;&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Experimental verification!&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;You are going
                        to verify <em>that</em>?&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;The experiment!&rdquo; cried Filby, who was getting
                        brain-weary.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see your experiment anyhow,&rdquo; said the
                        Psychologist, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s all humbug, you know.&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and
                        with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the
                        room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his
                        laboratory.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The Psychologist looked at us. &ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;s
                        got?&rdquo;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        &ldquo;Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,&rdquo; said the Medical Man,
                        and Filby tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before
                        he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby&rsquo;s
                        anecdote collapsed.
